## Why not use the TickTick Focus timer?

Time blocking my day AND then using a separate tool to time how long tasks actually take is just too much hassle. It adds unnecessary friction. Time management need not be this complicated. I want to see how my time is spent right in the calendar. But if I display Focus timer stats in calendar, it will get clogged with duplicate time blocks.

I adjust the start and end times for time blocks throughout the day — that's all the time tracking I need. Unfortunately, TickTick does not provide any stats for one's agenda.
